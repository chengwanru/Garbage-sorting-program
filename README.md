# Garbage-sorting-program
That program aims to help people sort garbage.
You need to upload a picture of the garbage you want to sort. And then run the program, the program will give you what the type of that garbage depand on the big data image library. There are four types of waste: Dry waste, Household food waste, Hazardous Garbage, Recyclable Garbage.
Besides, I set up a database, the previously classified garbage will be stored in the database. It can be fast to sort this garbage next time.
I will upload an example of running the program, people can watch the radio first.
